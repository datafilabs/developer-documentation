# Step 1: Connect Your Data


You first need to create a user account and workspace. If you donâ€™t have an account click [here](https://home.datafi.us/register) to register for a free account.

There are three ways to connect your data to your Datafi workspace. 

1) You can setup a self-hosted Edge Server
   - Steps to step a self-hosted edge server are available [here](../3.edge-servers/3.self-hosted.md)

2) Use a Datafi hosted Edge Server (Serverless)
   - More details about the Datafi Hosted Edge Servers are available [here](../3.edge-servers/2.datafi-hosted.md) 
   - To use this, login to [Datafi Cloud](https://home.datafi.us), click Add on the left sidebar and select 'Add New DataSet'

3) Direct upload CSV files
   - We support uploading your CSV data to Datafi Cloud, and access it similar to any other dataset.
