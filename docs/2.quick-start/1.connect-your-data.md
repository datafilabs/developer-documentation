# Step 1: Connect Your Data


You first need to create a user account and workspace. If you donâ€™t have an account <a href="https://home.datafi.us/register" target="_blank">click here to register for a free account</a>

There are three ways to connect your data to your Datafi workspace. 

1) You can setup a self-hosted Edge Server
   - steps to step a self-hosted edge server is [available here](../3.edge-servers/3.self-hosted.md)

2) Use a Datafi hosted Edge Server (Serverless)
   - More details of the Datafi Hosted Edge Servers are [available here](../3.edge-servers/2.datafi-hosted.md) 
   - To use this. Login to [Datafi Cloud](https://home.datafi.us) , Click on Add on the left sidebar and select 'Add New Dataset'

3) Directly upload CSV files
   - We support uploading your CSV data to dataficloud. and access it similar to any other dataset you are connecting though Datafi.
   - To do this. Login to [Datafi Cloud](https://home.datafi.us) , Click on Add on the left sidebar and select 'Upload Datafile'
