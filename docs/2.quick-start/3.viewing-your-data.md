# Step 2: Viewing your data

On the [DataView](https://home.datafi.us/dataview) page you will be able to see a list of datasets that you have access to. Choosing a record from one of them will open the contents of that dataset based on the rules defined for the dataset. 

In addition to DataView, you can also create [DataApps](https://home.datafi.us/dataapp), which are no-code apps that can be created in Datafi using the datasets connected to your workspace.

Both DataView and DataApps can be shared with other users in your workspace. Each users who's viewing your app can have data based on the policies and rules you set for them.
