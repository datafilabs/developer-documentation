# Step 2: Viewing your data

On the [DataView](https://home.datafi.us/dataview) page you will be able to see a list of datasource that you have access to on the left side of you screen. Choosing a table from one of them will open the contents of that dataset based on the rules and permissions configured for the dataset. It will also mask fields according to any rules specified.

In addition to DataView, you can also create [DataApps](https://home.datafi.us/dataapp), which are no-code apps that can be created in Datafi on top of the Data connected to the platform.

Both DataView and DataApps can be shared with other users in your workspace. Each users who's viewing your app can have data based on the policies and rules you set for the dataset/record.
