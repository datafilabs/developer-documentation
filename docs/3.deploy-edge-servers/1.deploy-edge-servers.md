# Deploy Edge Servers

Edge server is the data control plane in Datafi. for connecting to any data-source an edge-server needs to be deployed and provisioned with credentials and other details of the datasource.

There are two types of edge server deployments

## 1. Datafi Hosted

In this case, Datafi will do the heavy lift to deploy and provision edge-server in datafi's cloud infrastructure. You need to provide service level access credentials to the data-source to connect to. This can be done by going to Datafi Console (https://home.datafi.us) and click on the button 'Add Dataset'

## 2. Self Hosted

This will be helpful in cases when you need additional security for the data as you have full control over the network the edge-server is hosted on. This will also make sure that the 'data' from your datasource is not flowing through Datafi's network. instead it can be configured that it will be passed directly from your datasource to the end-users browser, with right level of security and privacy applied at the edge-server level.

Next session will guide you though setting up an Edge server in your local machine. you can use the same method to self-host the edge server anywhere you want.
