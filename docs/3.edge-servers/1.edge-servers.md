# Datafi Edge Servers 

An Edge server is the data control plane for each dataset in your workspace. Each dataset in your workspace requires one or more Edge Servers to be provisioned and configured with authentication details for the data source.

There are two types of Edge Server deployments

1. [Datafi Hosted](./2.datafi-hosted.md) : Serverless Edge Servers hosted in Datafi Cloud. Hosted and managed by Datafi.

2. [Self Hosted](./3.self-hosted.md) : Containerized Edge Servers hosted by you locally, On-premises, or in your cloud provider.
