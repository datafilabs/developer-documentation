# Datafi Hosted Edge Servers

Edge server is the data control plane in Datafi. For connecting to any data-source an edge-server needs to be deployed and provisioned with credentials and other details of the datasource.

In this case, Datafi will do the heavy lift to deploy and provision edge-server in datafi's cloud infrastructure. You need to provide service level access credentials to the data-source to connect to. This can be done by going to Datafi Console (https://home.datafi.us) and click on the button 'Add Dataset'

> To connect your datasource though Datafi hosted edge servers, It should have connectivity from our cloud servers. We use NAT gateways to access the datasource, for improved security you can limit access to only the outbound IP addresses we use in your workspace. To know the outbound IP address for the Datafi hosted edge servers in your workspace, please contact support.
