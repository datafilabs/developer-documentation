# Datafi Hosted Edge Servers

Edge server is the data control plane in Datafi. For connecting to any data source an Edge Server needs to be deployed and provisioned with credentials and other details of the datasource.

In this case, Datafi will do the heavy lift to deploy and provision edge-server in datafi's cloud infrastructure. You need to provide service level access credentials to the data-source to connect to. This can be done by going to Datafi Console (https://home.datafi.us) and click on the button 'Add Dataset'

> To connect your data source though Datafi hosted edge servers, it requires direct access from our cloud servers. We use NAT gateways to access the data source, for improved security you can limit access to only the outbound IP addresses defined for your workspace. To know the outbound IP address, please contact support.
