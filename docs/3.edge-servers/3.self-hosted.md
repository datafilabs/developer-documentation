# Self Hosted Edge Servers 

This will be helpful in cases when you need additional security for the data as you have full control over the network the edge-server is hosted on. This will also make sure that the 'data' from your datasource is not flowing through Datafi's network. instead it can be configured that it will be passed directly from your datasource to the end-users browser, with right level of security and privacy applied at the edge-server level.

Next session will guide you though setting up an Edge server in your local machine. you can use the same method to self-host the edge server anywhere you want.
