# Self Hosted Edge Servers 

This will be helpful in cases when you need additional security for the data as you have full control over the network the Edge Server is hosted on. This will also make sure that the data from your data source is not flowing through Datafi's network. Instead it can be configured that it will be passed directly from your data source to the end-users browser, with right level of security and privacy applied at the Edge Server.

Next session will guide you though setting up an Edge server in your local machine. You can use the same method to self-host multiple Edge Server anywhere.
